Passive Income Clips (PIC) Project Creation Log
===============================================

This log captures the steps taken to assemble the PIC Akatsuki agents
prototype on a Windows‑friendly environment. The goal was to create a
system that uses a shared chat interface to coordinate a series of AI
agents modeled after Akatsuki characters. The result can be packaged
into a standalone executable for distribution via GitHub.

Steps performed:

1. **Environment setup**: Created a new directory `pic_project` and
   extracted the provided iPhone‑style chat UI starter into
   `pic_akatsuki`. The UI consists of `index.html`, `styles.css`,
   `app.js` and a simple Flask bridge in `bridge/bridge.py`.

2. **Bridge server**: Wrote `pic_project/bridge.py`, a Flask
   application that exposes `/messages` and `/send` endpoints. It reads
   and writes JSON messages from a configurable `PIC_CHAT_DIR`.

3. **Message utilities**: Added `pic_project/utils/message_handler.py`
   containing helper functions to read, write and construct messages
   using the agreed schema. This encapsulates file operations and
   simplifies agent code.

4. **Agent loader**: Wrote `pic_project/agents/__init__.py` to allow
   dynamic loading of agent modules by name. This supports the modular
   design of the Akatsuki agents.

5. **Pain agent**: Implemented the stub `pic_project/agents/pain.py`.
   Pain responds to messages containing a `clip_summary:` directive by
   generating a dummy PIC task sheet. It broadcasts this as a system
   message and replies to `/status` with a simple operational note.

6. **Dispatcher**: Developed `pic_project/run.py` which starts the
   bridge server in a thread and then enters a polling loop. It reads
   new messages from the log, determines the target agents and invokes
   their `handle_message` functions. Responses are appended back to
   the log.

7. **Documentation**: Added a comprehensive README explaining how to
   run the project, interact with the chat UI, extend agents, and
   package the system into a Windows `.exe` using PyInstaller. This
   ensures easy redeployment from GitHub.

8. **Packaging guidance**: Included instructions on using PyInstaller
   to create a one‑file executable. While the project cannot be
   cross‑compiled to Windows in this environment, the README provides
   the necessary commands.

9. **Logging**: Summarized these steps in this log file for later
   reference. A more detailed logging system could be added in
   production.

With these components in place, the PIC prototype can be run locally
by starting the dispatcher (`python -m pic_project.run`) and opening
the chat UI (`index.html`) in a browser. Packaging into a `.exe` can
be accomplished with PyInstaller as outlined in the README.
